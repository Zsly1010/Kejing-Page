title: Welcome to my blog!

My name is Kejing Chang, and I'm a undergraduate year 4 student @XJTLU majoring Information and Computing Science. 

Currently, I'm interested in cybersecurity and I'm planning to pursue a Master degree (info-sec field hopfully)

This is a temporary blog for me to record my life and thoughts (may be too late?). Thank you for your watching and if you have any suggestion please contact me without any hesitation.
